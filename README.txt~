Data Transfer via Visible Light Communication

This is our implementation of Data Transfer via Visible Light Communication (Python 2.7, C)

Here are some of the salient features of the project:
	Support for Real-time transfer of data from Host1 to Host2 using the RaspberryPi and the Arduino Uno. 
	Support for generic file transfer from Host1 to Host2 using RaspberryPi and the Arduino. 
	Provision of reliability using ACKs, NAKs and SYNC messages.  
	In-order delivery of data
	Guaranteed data delivery 

Components:
	Raspberry Pi
	Arduino
	LED, Photodiode, Resistors

Compatibility:
	Python 2.7, GCC
	

Operating Systems Tested on:
	Linux
	Raspbian 

Instructions to Run:
	Run all code as root. 
	Change ServerName in Pi.py to current IP address of RaspberryPi.
	In case of file transfer, make sure the file to be transferred is present in the same directory as the code on Host 1. 	
	Make sure the server process(Pi.py) is running on the Raspbian. 
	Execute the Host 1 process(Reader.py) and enter the port number for Host 1
	Execute the Host 2 process(SerialRead.py) for data/file transfer, enter the port number. 
	Host 1 will select file transfer/console input mode.
	Host 2 will select file write/console output mode.
	In case of file transfer, Host 2 enters file name(with extension), followed by Host 1 entering file name. In case of console input, 		the Host 1 starts typing.
	Order of execution is important.
